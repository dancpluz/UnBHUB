Fun project developed as a group for the final project of the "T√©cnicas de Programa√ß√£o 1" (Programming Techniques 1) college subject, in which we learned about object-oriented programming, interfaces, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. For the project, we had the choice of using Swing or JavaFX, so we chose JavaFX because of the CSS support and more recent features. We used Apache NetBeans 15 as the text editor and builder, Gluon Scene Builder to make the interfaces, Java 8, and JavaFX 19. We also made a report describing the project with more details, available only in Portuguese [here](README_report.md).

## üöÄ Objective

The application consists of finding products and ranking establishments inside the campus. Users can either be an owner or a client, owners can create stores and manage them, and clients can search and rate any store with comments and a grade. As an arbitrary rule, the platform is only for establishments inside the university (Universidade de Bras√≠lia) campus. The rating grades are inspired by the grading system inside the university.

## üìå Features

The name was inspired by mixing two words "UnB" the university of Bras√≠lia abbreviation, and "Busca" which means "search", a straightforward concept to show that is an app to search for something from the university. Made a really nice logo in Adobe Illustrator with the name and two graphic elements, the star in the "U" letter to remind of the rating system, and the search bar, which shows the main purpose of the app. Using a simple pallette that consists of three colors, we followed basic UI concepts to design.
